           On May 11th, an Instagram account surfaced on the phones of many current and former New Roads students, as well as those of faculty and administration. The account was called Dear New Roads School. In one of their first posts, they alleged that within “the past few months, some harmful, problematic events have taken place at New Roads. Educators, students, parents, alumni, and other community members have confronted the leadership and Board of Trustees on the school’s institutional bias and dysfunction.” They suggested that those who felt they were silenced by the school use the account as a platform to share school-related “personal experiences” regarding racism, sexism, transphobia and other forms of discrimination. Over the next few weeks, a multitude of submissions were published on the account, shocking many students and driving the buzz around school—to the extent where sarcastically threatening to “DearNewRoads” someone became commonplace in the upper school’s vernacular. The idea of an Instagram account created to expose injustices within a school community is nothing new in Los Angeles, especially among independent schools(see Jill Shah’s “‘They can’t silence us.’ Instagram accounts recount racism at L.A.’s elite private schools” - LA Times), but as Shah reports, some of these schools, after seeing these accounts firsthand began “working to develop a protocol that allows [students] to share responses to [incidents of discrimination]. [The head of school at Oakwood] said that the school began a conversation with students, alumni, faculty and parents as soon as the account was started.” So with no response from the New Roads administration, I took it into my own hands to ask them the questions that deserved answers. 
<p>
Note: After weeks of back-and-forth, the @DearNewRoadsSchool account declined to comment for this article, citing that "the New Roads School Administration still has not replied to our communications. We believe that New Roads officials are the most appropriate personnel to make initial engagement with.” 
<p>
<p>
SB: An Instagram account called @DearNewRoadsSchool (Dear New Roads) is posting stories from students, alumni and faculty who feel they’ve been “ignored, dismissed and silenced” by NRS executive leadership through submitting stories about injustices around racism and other forms of discrimination, misconduct and even violence. How did you discover the account and what was your initial reaction, emotionally or otherwise, to viewing the messages? How is your reaction changing as the account grows and develops?
<p>
NRS: Recently an employee shared the information regarding this anonymous account with the administration. The administration is deeply saddened reading the posts and that people are using Instagram instead of coming to any member of the leadership team with their painful stories so that we could responsibly handle the issues with compassion. The administration wants to hear any student concerns individually and harbors no ill will for any who felt that anonymous posting was the only way they were comfortable sharing their feelings. It is always
<p>
hard to hear that the school may have failed a student in any respect, but despite our highest aspirations, we are not exempt from the challenges of our larger society. We have always been able to grow from painful experiences when we are respectfully honest with each other, and work to heal the community for our health and common good. At the same time, because our school is committed to educating and graduating courageous people of conscience who advocate for others after they are fully informed, we are proud to see so many students rallying to a call for justice. However, there’s little we can do to address matters posted anonymously without sufficient information and context. If an individual wants to meet with our administration, we will do a thorough review of any claims - even if the incident preceded the tenure of some of the current administrators. Anyone who would like to share an incident should contact our Associate Head of School, Ryan Hawley, at rhawley@newroads.org.
<p>
SB: A big part of the account is highlighting what some call a "lack of transparency" from the administration on issues that affect the students. In the eyes of the student body, it seems that one day, you're in class with your favorite teacher, and the next they're gone without explanation. I understand that there are legal repercussions to discussing personnel issues, however students seem to find out pieces of the story, which only grow into horrible rumors about these things happening. How can we ensure that sufficient information is getting to students so rumors don't spread?
<p>
NRS: We know the magic of New Roads is how close and connected our students are with our teachers. We completely understand how any abrupt changes of faculty or administration are painful and confusing. We do our best and continually seek to improve on our efforts to minimize the negative impacts to our students and community. However, our administrators must be vigilant with all of the legal, moral, and ethical responsibilities of New Roads, and therefore must protect the privacy of all individuals, including on issues of employment. Because the school cannot legally share any information concerning the context or reasons for an employment decision, any communication about such decisions will fail to satisfy; however, this is a circumstance where the individual employee’s right to privacy has to take precedence. Every hard decision this leadership team has to make about employment is made only when many points of view and factors, grounded in fact, are considered. It is our responsibility to work as productively as possible with students, teachers, staff and administrators. That does not mean we can always avoid conflict, fulfill every aspiration, or meet specific demands. The job of the administration is to protect the sacred learning and teaching environment for everyone, and that is the basis upon which we make all of our most difficult decisions.
<p>
SB: If you believe the allegations on Dear New Roads are misleading, inaccurate or dangerous, what can the administration do to help students understand the fuller picture?
<p>
NRS: We believe that most people who are posting feel they are trying to help raise awareness about the work we still have to do as a society and a school, but we know some statements are inaccurate, cruel and dangerous. We also believe that it could be just as harmful to respond directly to any of them, and we will not be doing so. These posts--whether accurate or not--reflect deeply personal and private matters, and there is no way to provide a “fuller picture” without making information public that as a policy and for legal reasons, we cannot.
<p>
We, unfortunately, live in an age where information is often distorted, decontextualized, and sensationalized to move forward an agenda. Personal attacks can replace engaging on ideas and principles, grounded in facts. New Roads' commitment to developing independent, respectfully skeptical thinkers is more critical to our community and democracy than ever. We again respectfully encourage anyone with concerns or incidents to report to contact our Associate Head of School at rhawley@newroads.org.
<p>
SB: Many of the issues being raised on the account are around race and discrimination. What would you say to those who believe New Roads needs some sort of outside DEI consultant to discuss these growing concerns with the students personally and to evaluate whether systemic dysfunction exists at the school?
<p>
NRS: New Roads is committed to engaging in the volatile, complex and emotionally charged issues of our time with love, compassion, and critical optimism. This administration believes that social justice must not be about retribution but about our mutual evolution. While New Roads has as an institution always been committed to intentionally disrupting attitudes, beliefs, systems, and practices that have plagued our country for 400 years in order to create a learning climate and culture, built on a foundation of respect for the inherent dignity and worth of the individual, we know there is more to do and already had taken steps to do so before the creation of this Instagram account. In his new role as Director of Student Wellbeing, Mario Johonson, who has been at New Roads since nearly the founding of the school, will lead us to intentionally fulfill the promise of our mission in a humane and empathetic way. He has our complete confidence to lead all our stakeholders through these important conversations. We believe we can develop the DEI capacity within our administration to have a lasting and sustainable impact on the inclusivity of our atmosphere, and we will, as we have in the past, bring in consultants to support our diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. Every choice we make about identity is designed to see, hear and respect all students and give them the loving space to evolve under our care. For any students who may be suffering from feeling they were unseen by this administration, or felt access to leadership cumbersome or intimidating, please reach out now to our Associate Head of School and help us understand your experience. We have to come together to help each other heal and learn. We want to celebrate our return to the campus and take this opportunity, provided by science and our collective perseverance, to be grateful for each other, to see one another’s humanity, and come together. 
<p>
SB: We talk so much at NRS about "speaking your truth" and "speaking truth to power." Dear New Roads was created in that spirit. Isn’t speaking out exactly what you expect from students? If this isn’t the ‘right’ way to do it, what’s a better way, particularly if people feel they haven’t been heard by going through traditional channels? 
<p>
NRS: What we try to teach is that “speaking your truth” also means understanding that there will always be someone with another perspective. Just as we do in our classes, we strive to create an environment in which people feel comfortable enough to share their truth respectfully while empathically hearing others with the goal of promoting greater understanding and the betterment of our community. We realize some people may find it more challenging to speak their truth for a variety of reasons, including real or perceived power differentials, and we are committed to striving so that all feel empowered to do so respectfully. We empathize with those who felt that anonymity was the only way that they could comfortably share their stories; however, if the goal is healing, justice, concrete solutions, and progress, we can only do that if they share their stories with us. We will do our best to treat anyone who shares their story with deep compassion and sensitivity. 
<p>
SB: Again, I acknowledge we cannot be privy to all the decisions made about faculty but what can you say to students who believe there has been a campaign of “Black attrition and push out,” as one person (who called themselves a former faculty member on Dear New Roads) put it, and that a “lack of support for Black faculty and students” hits harder because “if not New Roads, then who?” What’s your response to this and what are we as an institution doing regarding inclusion initiatives? 
<p>
NRS: We strongly disagree with any claim that the school has engaged in a campaign of systematic racism towards anyone. We would encourage people to realize we are one of the few schools in our region with an African-American Head of School. We also have one of the most diverse Senior Administrative teams, based on gender and race, among our peer schools. We are proud of that, but above all, we try to assemble the most talented and inspiring community of teachers, staff, and administrators of any race, who reflect our values of kindness, professionalism and inspired peacemaking. Black female faculty members who have been referenced left the school for a variety of reasons over the course of several years as is the case with other faculty members. We cannot engage on the specifics because of the privacy rights of those individuals. It has always been our top priority to have a diverse community of the very best teachers we can find who can show the judgement of character and demonstrate consistent care for their students and co-workers. Our teachers must hold appropriate professional boundaries with their students while maintaining the closeness that is the hallmark of New Roads. 
<p>
SB: In the face of the troubling stories surfacing on Dear New Roads, do you believe that the administration needs to make any changes? In what ways? 
<p>
NRS: We have to present a clearer path for students to speak to the administration when they need to be heard. We need to better educate our community about where the boundaries exist that protect our roles as constituents and stakeholders. Some posts on the site include important personal stories that deserve a private in-person meeting; however, some others are inflammatory personal attacks. We will continue to reflect on this to learn how we can continue to improve as a school. 
<p>
SB: Do you have anything else you think is important for the student body to know? 

NRS: People will never agree with all our decisions and that’s ok. We believe in what we are doing for our community and society. Our leadership team would put themselves between harm and every student, teacher and staff member. That is the greatest burden and honor of our jobs. </p>

            <p>It was this, as much as anything, that gave people courage, and I suppose the new arrivals from Woking also helped to restore confidence.  At any rate, as the dusk came on a slow, intermittent movement upon the sand pits began, a movement that seemed to gather force as the stillness of the evening about the cylinder remained unbroken.  Vertical black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and advance again, spreading out as they did so in a thin irregular crescent that promised to enclose the pit in its attenuated horns.  I, too, on my side began to move towards the pit.</p>

            <p>Then I saw some cabmen and others had walked boldly into the sand pits, and heard the clatter of hoofs and the gride of wheels.  I saw a lad trundling off the barrow of apples.  And then, within thirty yards of the pit, advancing from the direction of Horsell, I noted a little black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag.</p>
